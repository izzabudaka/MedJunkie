      <b>Option B (Sickle cell anaemia) is Correct.</b>
      Sickle cell disease is an example of a single nucleotide polymorphism. Individuals with the abnormal sickle cell haemoglobin are protected from
      <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>
      infection. Merozoites normally interact with red cells through two interactions that are dependent on
      <i>P. falciparum</i>
      erythrocyte membrane protein-1. These proteins are impaired in individuals with sickle cell haemoglobin, explaining why sickle cell disease has not been lost from the tropical world through natural selection.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option A (Turner's syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      Turner's syndrome is the result of the absence of one X chromosome (XO), not polymorphism.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option C (Fragile X syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      Fragile X syndrome is caused by single nucleotide polymorphism, where there are insertions of nucleotides in multiples of three. It does not protect against endemic infection.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option D (Huntington's disease) is Incorrect.</b>
      Huntington's disease is caused by triple nucleotide repeats in single nucleotide polymorphism.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option E (Ankylosing spondylitis) is Incorrect.</b>
      Ankylosing spondylitis patients express human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 genotype. The greatest single nucleotide polymorphism diversity is found on the HLA locus. Ankylosing spondylitis is not protective against endemic infection.
