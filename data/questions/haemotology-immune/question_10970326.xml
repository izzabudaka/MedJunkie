      <prompt>
        <p>Movement of water between the fluid compartments is determined by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is generated by the pumping action of the heart. Osmotic pressure is produced by solute concentration.</p>
        <p>When causing movement of water from the plasma to the interstitial fluid compartment, what does the colloid osmotic pressure oppose?</p>
      </prompt>

      <b>Option E (Hydrostatic pressure of the blood) is Correct.</b>
      The interstitial fluid is also different from blood plasma in that blood contains large amounts of protein, which cannot diffuse out of the blood because of the endothelium. This means that, whilst the ionic content of the plasma and the interstitial fluid is the same, the added protein in the plasma has an osmotic pull (called the colloid osmotic pressure) that opposes the hydrostatic pressure of the blood, which would tend to push fluid out of the blood into the interstitial fluid. This means that the volume of the blood compartment remains constant.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option A (The action of antidiuretic hormone) is Incorrect.</b>
      Antidiuretic hormone causes renal concentration of urine.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option B (Falls in the haematocrit) is Incorrect.</b>
      Falls in the haematocrit lower the plasma osmotic pressure and cause fluid to move into the circulation.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option C (Respiratory acidosis) is Incorrect.</b>
      Respiratory acidosis lowers tissue pH.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option D (Dehydration) is Incorrect.</b>
      Dehydration raises levels of antidiuretic hormone.
