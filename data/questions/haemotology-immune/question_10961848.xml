    <p>
      <b>Option D (Defence against helminth parasitic infestations) is Correct.</b>
      Eosinophils make up 1–6% total white cells in a healthy individual and have a striking orange appearance due to the cytoplasm that takes up eosin dye when blood films are stained. Eosinophils circulate in the peripheral blood for 4–5 h and then make their way to the tissues, where their main function is to provide defence against helminthes (worm) parasitic infestations. Eosinophils also have a role in the control of allergies and fighting viral infections. Certain cytokines stimulate the increased production of these cells (eosinophilia).

      <b>Option A (Defence against fungus) is Incorrect.</b>
      One of the main functions of eosinophils is defence against infestation by worms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Defence against bacteria) is Incorrect.</b>
      Defence against bacteria is a function of neutrophils.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Present antigens) is Incorrect.</b>
      Monocytes and macrophages ingest pathogenic material, degrades it and presents peptides or peptide fragments to T lymphocytes, hence they are known as antigen-presenting cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E (Serve as memory cells) is Incorrect.</b>
      Once a T lymphocyte (T cell) has been activated by antigen, it, and its mitotic descendants, are memory cells where they are more likely to be activated by the same antigen.
