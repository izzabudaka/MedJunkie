      <b>Option C (Two to five) is Correct.</b>
      Characteristics of neutrophils:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The nucleus contains between two and five lobes. Cytoplasmic granules contain proteolytic enzymes used to break down ingested material, e.g. pathogenic bacteria. The function of neutrophils is defence against bacteria and fungi.</li>
      <li>Neutrophils are attracted to sites of infection by chemoattractant chemicals to which they are very sensitive: bacterial cell wall proteins and endothelial cell molecules, such as leukotrienes.</li>
      <li>The various neutrophil granules contain several different proteins that fulfil the different functions of adhesion and bacterial killing; their release (neutrophil degranulation) is stimulated by leukotrienes and chemoattractants. The azurophilic granules contain enzymes that kill bacteria, such as lysozyme and myeloperoxidase, and others that facilitate the process, such as increasing membrane permeability.</li>
    </ul>
