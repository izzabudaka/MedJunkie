      <b>Option D (5%) is Correct.</b>
      Monocytes are larger than neutrophils and make up around 5% of circulating white cells. The nucleus is characteristically kidney-shaped (indented), with vacuoles within the cytoplasm. Monocytes contain granules that store acid hydrolases and myeloperoxidase. Monocytes and macrophages can ingest pathogenic material; degrade it and present peptides or peptide fragments to T lymphocytes. Because of this function, monocytes and macrophages are called antigen-presenting cells
      <i>,</i>
      since they present antigen to T cells. Monocytes circulate for about 10 h in the blood before they mature into tissue macrophages. Their main role is to kill intracellular microorganisms, such as
      <i>Listeria</i>
      , mycobacteria and some fungi.

      <b>Option B (20–40%) is Incorrect.</b>
      Monocytes make up about 5% of circulating white cells.

      Monocytes make up about 5% of circulating white cells.
