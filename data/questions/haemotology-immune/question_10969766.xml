      <b>Option B (Most (90%) of the carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate ions) is Correct.</b>
      Several mechanisms are responsible for carbon dioxide transport, and there are significant roles for both the plasma and the red cells. Almost 90% of the carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate ions, about 5% is dissolved, and about 5% is transported as carbamino-haemoglobin. A negligible amount of oxygen is dissolved, but carbon dioxide (CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      ) is about 20 times more soluble than oxygen. Deoxygenated blood carries more carbon dioxide than oxygenated blood (Haldane effect), and this facilitates the uptake of carbon dioxide from the tissues and its delivery to the pulmonary capillaries.
