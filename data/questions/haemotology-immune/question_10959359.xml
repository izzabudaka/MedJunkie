      <b>Option C (Found in multipotent stem cells; increased impression leads to proliferation of these cells and reduction results in a loss of haematopoiesis) is Correct.</b>
      Laboratory animals, such as zebrafish, provide the opportunity for much molecular research. GATA-2 expression in this animal is associated with areas of haematopoiesis. It is also found on multipotent stem cells. Increased expression of GATA-2 leads to proliferation of these cells, and a reduction results in a loss of haematopoiesis.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option A (Forms a complex with Tal-1/SCL; responsible for producing blood when in utero) is Incorrect.</b>
      Rbtn2/LMO2 forms a complex with Tal-1/SCL; responsible for producing blood when in utero.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option B (Found in association with multipotent progenitors; its absence leads to a failure of erythroid cell production with cells not developing beyond the primitive proerythroblast) is Incorrect.</b>
      GATA-1 is found in association with multipotent progenitors; its absence leads to a failure of erythroid cell production with cells not developing beyond the primitive proerythroblast.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option D (Over-expression leads to cells developing down the myeloid lineage) is Incorrect.</b>
      Over-expression of PU.1 leads to cells developing down the myeloid lineage.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option E (Thought to be important at very early stages of erythropoiesis, at the multipotent or myeloid–erythroid stem cell level) is Incorrect.</b>
      Tal-1/SCL is thought to be important at very early stages of erythropoiesis, at the multipotent or myeloid–erythroid stem cell level.
