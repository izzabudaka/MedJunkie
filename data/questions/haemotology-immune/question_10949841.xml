    <p>
      <b>Option C (Blast cells with Auer rod in bone marrow aspirate) is Correct.</b>
      This finding indicates acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The presence of immature white cells; leukaemic blast cells, in the peripheral blood is a feature of acute leukemia. Further investigations will be needed to differentiate between myeloid and lymphoid forms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bone marrow biopsy will usually show increased cellularity with most cells being abnormal blast cells.</li>
      <li>Cytochemical staining (using different stains that detect specific proteins, carbohydrates and lipids characteristic of particular cell lineages) helps to distinguish different forms of leukaemia; AML blast cells with Auer rods, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) blasts and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Option A (Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)) is Incorrect.</b>
      The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (High white cell count of granulocytic lineage in the peripheral blood) is Incorrect.</b>
      A very high white count up to >100x10
      <sup>9</sup>
      /L is characteristic of chronic leukaemia. Mainly granulocytic cells at all stages of development are features of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option D (High white cell count with mainly mature lymphocytes with ‘smear’ cells in peripheral blood film) is Incorrect.</b>
      A very high white count up to >100x10
      <sup>9</sup>
      /L is characteristic of chronic leukaemia. A high proportion of mature lymphocytes with ‘smear’ cells produced when the blood film is made indicates chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Option E (Red granules in blast cells from marrow aspirate using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain) is Incorrect.</b>
      Acute lymphocytic leukaemic (ALL) blasts contain glycogen, which is stained red by PAS. Normal lymphocytes do not contain glycogen.
