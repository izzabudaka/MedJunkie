            <div>
              A 30-year-old vegan presents to the clinic with several years' history of sore tongue, loose stools and poor balance with pins and needles in her feet. On examination, a smooth tongue is noted. Neurological examination reveals decreased vibration sense and proprioception in the toes bilaterally.
              <br/>
              A full blood count reveals a megaloblastic anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Blood film showed ‘Tear drop’ poikilocytes, Basophilic stippling and Howell Jolly bodies, hypersegmented neutrophils.

              During a routine clinic appointment, a 45-year-old man with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mentions that he has had increasing breathlessness and fatigue over the last several months. Examination is unremarkable apart from pallor and a palpable splenic notch.
              <br/>
              Full blood count revealed a normocytic anaemia with a blood film showing spherocytes and polychromatic red cells. Further tests showed high reticulocyte count and LDH, and low haptoglobin levels with a positive direct Coombs' test.

            <div>
              A 60-year-old man is brought to A&amp;E following a 999 call by his wife when he collapsed at home. He is normally fit and well apart from a history of peptic ulcer disease and osteoarthritis. Recently he has complained of increasing fatigue and breathlessness but put this down to age and being slightly overweight. He saw his GP 3 weeks ago for his hip arthritis and had been prescribed diclofenac 50 mg t.d.s. and co-codamol 30/500 mg p.r.n. He is on no other medication and has no known allergies.
              <br/>
              On examination, he is pale and clammy with a pulse of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg. Cardiovascular examination reveals a sinus tachycardia, and chest auscultation is clear. His abdomen is distended and tender with signs of peritonism. Digital rectal examination reveals offensive dark-coloured stool.

              A newborn baby of a Japanese couple is admitted to the Neonatal Special Care Unit with kernicterus and splenomegaly. Blood tests revealed he has a raised mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemaglobin concentration (MCHC) and reticulocyte count. An osmotic fragility test confirmed the diagnosis (see diagram below).

        Option F (
        <b>Acquired autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA)</b>
        ) is correct.
      </b>
      Blood parameters would show a low haptoglobin (as haptoglobin binds free haemoglobin and the Hp–Hb complex is removed by the reticuloendothelial system).
      <br/>
      A positive Coombs' test (detection of red cells coated with antibody or complement) is also found. Blood film showed spherocytes (due to a partial loss of the red cell membrane, possibly during partial phagocytosis stimulated by antibodies on the cell surface) and polychromatic red cells (young red cells or reticulocytes produced in response to the haemolysis).
