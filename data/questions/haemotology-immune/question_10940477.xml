            <div>
              A 30-year-old vegan presents to the clinic with several years' history of sore tongue, loose stools and poor balance with pins and needles in her feet. On examination, a smooth tongue is noted. Neurological examination reveals decreased vibration sense and proprioception in the toes bilaterally.
              <br/>
              A full blood count reveals a megaloblastic anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Blood film showed ‘Tear drop’ poikilocytes, Basophilic stippling and Howell Jolly bodies, hypersegmented neutrophils.

              During a routine clinic appointment, a 45-year-old man with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mentions that he has had increasing breathlessness and fatigue over the last several months. Examination is unremarkable apart from pallor and a palpable splenic notch.
              <br/>
              Full blood count revealed a normocytic anaemia with a blood film showing spherocytes and polychromatic red cells. Further tests showed high reticulocyte count and LDH, and low haptoglobin levels with a positive direct Coombs' test.

            <div>
              A 60-year-old man is brought to A&amp;E following a 999 call by his wife when he collapsed at home. He is normally fit and well apart from a history of peptic ulcer disease and osteoarthritis. Recently he has complained of increasing fatigue and breathlessness but put this down to age and being slightly overweight. He saw his GP 3 weeks ago for his hip arthritis and had been prescribed diclofenac 50 mg t.d.s. and co-codamol 30/500 mg p.r.n. He is on no other medication and has no known allergies.
              <br/>
              On examination, he is pale and clammy with a pulse of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg. Cardiovascular examination reveals a sinus tachycardia, and chest auscultation is clear. His abdomen is distended and tender with signs of peritonism. Digital rectal examination reveals offensive dark-coloured stool.

              A newborn baby of a Japanese couple is admitted to the Neonatal Special Care Unit with kernicterus and splenomegaly. Blood tests revealed he has a raised mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemaglobin concentration (MCHC) and reticulocyte count. An osmotic fragility test confirmed the diagnosis (see diagram below).

            <div>A 25-year-old woman with a history of fibroids presents to her GP complaining of increasing fatigue over the last 6 months. Full blood count shows a microcytic hypochromic anaemia and the film shows small pale red cells, with pencil cells and target cells.</div>
