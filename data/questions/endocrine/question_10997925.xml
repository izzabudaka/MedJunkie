      <b>Option C is Correct.</b>
      The clinical features in this patient are consistent with chronic glucocorticoid excess.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A is Incorrect.</b>
      Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency with reduced mineralocorticoid production. It is commonly due to autoimmune disease. Clinical features include depression, postural hypotension, skin pigmentation, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hypoglycaemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B is Incorrect.</b>
      Conn's syndrome is characterized by hyperaldosteronism causing salt and water retention. Clinical features are hypertension, hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D is Incorrect.</b>
      Hypopituitarism is due to reduced secretion of anterior pituitary hormones: growth hormone, gonadotrophins, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticoid hormone. Clinical features include central obesity, dry wrinkly skin, amenorrhoea, reduced libido, reduced fertility and failure of lactation. There are also features of hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency (without skin pigmentation).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E is Incorrect.</b>
      Prolactinoma can be a micro- or macroadenoma of the pituitary. In women, it causes amenorrhoea, infertility and galactorrhoea. In men, it causes impotence, galactorrhoea and reduced facial hair.
