        <p>A 19-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus is seen in the outpatients’ clinic. She has been on subcutaneous insulin for 4 years. Her diary of home fingerstick glucose levels is very variable. A glycosylated haemoglobin is 11.2%.</p>
        <p>To prevent long-term vascular complications what should her glycosylated haemoglobin be?</p>
      </prompt>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_000">Aim for a glycosylated haemoglobin of less than 4.0%</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_001">Aim for a glycosylated haemoglobin of 4.0–6.9%</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_002">Aim for a glycosylated haemoglobin of 7–7.5%</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_003">Aim for a glycosylated haemoglobin of 7.6–11.0%</simpleChoice>

    <p>
      <b>Option C is Correct.</b>
      The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends a target level of glycosylated haemoglobin of less than 7.5% in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A is Incorrect.</b>
      This target glycosylated haemoglobin is too low and would be associated with a significant risk of episodes of hypoglycaemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B is Incorrect.</b>
      Whilst the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends a target glycosylated haemoglobin level of less than 6.5% in those at increased arterial risk (e.g. previous stroke or myocardial infarction), this patient does not fit this criterion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D is Incorrect.</b>
      This target glycosylated haemoglobin is too high and would be associated with an increased long-term risk of vascular complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E is Incorrect.</b>
      This target glycosylated haemoglobin is too high and would be associated with an increased long-term risk of vascular complications.
