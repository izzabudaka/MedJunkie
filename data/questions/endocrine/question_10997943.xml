    <p>
      <b>Option A (Breast abscess) is Correct.</b>
      Presents as a tender, swollen lump. Often has a significant amount of overlying skin erythema. There may be a fluctuant area, surrounded by hard areas of induration. Common in breastfeeding women.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Breast cyst) is Incorrect.</b>
      Breast cysts are discrete fluid filled swellings within the breast. They are smooth and mobile and can lead to localized tenderness. They are common in premenopausal women.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Fat necrosis) is Incorrect.</b>
      Occurs following trauma to the breast. Presents as a hard lump which is attached to the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D (Fibroadenoma) is Incorrect.</b>
      A fibroadenoma is a benign solitary, solid, rubbery breast lesion, which is characteristically smooth, non-tender and freely mobile. Common in young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E (Fibroadenosis) is Incorrect.</b>
      Fibroadenosis is a benign breast condition where one or more lumps are present with symptoms of pain and nodularity, which are characteristically associated with the patient's menstrual cycle. Presents in pre-menopausal women.
