      <prompt>
        <p>A 17-year-old girl comes to see you with primary amenorrhoea. She describes no medical problems and does not take medications. She is not sexually active. She is 1.67Â m in height and has well-developed secondary sexual characteristics, but ultrasound suggests an absent uterus. Examination under general anaesthetic reveals a blind-ending vagina, with a hypoplastic uterus.</p>
        <p>What is your diagnosis?</p>

    <p>
      <b>Option D (Testicular feminization) is Correct.</b>
      Patients with testicular feminization have a blind vagina with no uterus or a hypoplastic uterus. Secondary sexual characteristics are well developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A (Down's syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      Down's syndrome is associated with congenital heart defects and gastrointestinal wall defects. Abnormal development of the uterus and vagina are not typical features, although the menstrual cycle may be erratic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Klinefelter's syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      Those with Klinefelter's syndrome characteristically have an XXY chromosomal complement, with a male phenotype.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Patau's syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      Patau's syndrome is trisomy 13 and most babies affected die within their first year of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E (Turner's syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is characterized by the karyotype 45XO. While primary amenorrhoea is common, breast development is poor and patients have a short stature.
