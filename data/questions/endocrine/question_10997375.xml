        <p>A 16-year-old girl presents in clinic with primary amenorrhoea. Her height is 1.4 m and direct questioning confirms that her secondary sexual characteristics have yet to develop. She was born by a normal delivery and achieved her developmental milestones appropriately. She does not suffer from any medical problems and is doing well at school.</p>
        <p>Examination reveals a short webbed neck, with cubitus valgus. She has a shield-like chest with widely separated nipples. On listening to the chest, a murmur can be heard.</p>

      <b>Option E (Turner's syndrome) is Correct.</b>
      Patients with Turner's syndrome often have streak gonads which are dysfunctional. Cardiovascular defects include coarctation of the aorta, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect and aortic stenosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A (Congenital adrenal hyperplasia) is Incorrect.</b>
      Presentation is usually with vomiting, dehydration, seizures and ambiguous genitalia in the neonate. Precocious puberty is seen in boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (McCune-Albright syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      This syndrome presents with skin pigmentation and precocious puberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Trisomy 18) is Incorrect.</b>
      The majority of infants affected with trisomy 18 die within the first year of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D (Trisomy 21) is Incorrect.</b>
      While patients with Down syndrome often have short stature and congenital heart disease, a low IQ is common.
