      <prompt>
        <p>A 58-year-old man on amiodarone for supraventricular tachycardia presents with insomnia, sweating, diarrhoea and palpitations. On examination, there is atrial fibrillation, a tremor and moist skin. Thyroid function tests reveal:</p>
        <p>Thyroid-stimulating hormone 0.3 mU/L (normal range 0.2â€“4.5 mU/L)</p>
        <p>Free thyroxine 40 pmol/L (normal range 9-21 pmol/L)</p>
        <p>Tri-iodiothyronine 3 nmol/L (normal range 0.9-2.4nmol/L)</p>
        <p>What is the most appropriate management?</p>
      </prompt>

    <p>
      <b>Option E (Stop amiodarone) is Correct.</b>
      Amiodarone has a high concentration of iodine and it has a long half-life. This patient has iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis. Termination of amiodarone is necessary to control his thyrotoxic state. Given the long half-life of amiodarone, he may require carbimazole.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A (Aspirin) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is used to treat de Quervain's thyroiditis. This disease is due to a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection. It results in a painful thyroid swelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Levothyroxine) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is used to treat hypothyroidism. The patient has a pulse that is not bradycardic, which is a feature of hypothyroidism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Propanolol) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is used in hyperthyroidism and thyroid crisis. Such a patient would be tachycardic, i.e. have a pulse rate >100 beats/min.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D (Radioiodine) is Incorrect.</b>
      Iodine 131 is used to treat thyrotoxicosis and thyroid carcinoma. Its use may cause thyroiditis. In this patient r adioiodine is not effective due to reduced uptake by the thyroid gland.
