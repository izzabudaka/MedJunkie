      <prompt>
        <p>An overweight 40-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of worsening lethargy. She says that she constantly feels tired and cold, despite a healthy diet and no major changes in lifestyle. She also complains of hair thinning and menorrhagia. She is medically fit and does not take any medications.</p>
        <p>Examination reveals coarse facial features with rough and dry skin. Her hair is dry and brittle, and the outer third of her eyebrows has also thinned. Reflexes are sluggish.</p>
        <p>What investigation should be requested?</p>
      </prompt>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_000">Abdominal X-ray</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_001">Haemoglobin level</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_002">Luteinizing hormone (LH):follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_003">Plasma cortisol level</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_004">Thyroid function tests</simpleChoice>

    <p>
      <b>Option E is Correct.</b>
      The history suggests a presentation of hypothyroidism, which can be diagnosed by requesting thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A is Incorrect.</b>
      Abdominal X-ray will not assist the diagnosis here; the patient has not presented with gastrointestinal symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B is Incorrect.</b>
      Although anaemia may explain the patient's tiredness, this does not cause coarse facial features or sluggish reflexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C is Incorrect.</b>
      Whilst this investigation would be helpful in identifying menopause or polycystic ovarian syndrome, there is no suggestion of either of those two diagnoses in this presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D is Incorrect.</b>
      There are no suggestions of Cushing's or Conn's syndrome and cortisol will therefore not be as useful as thyroid function tests in the first instance.
