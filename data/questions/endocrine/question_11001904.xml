      <prompt>
        <p>You are asked to perform a clinical examination of a 38-year-old woman who complains of excessive sweating. On inspection, she is anxious, her palms are moist and her pulse is 98 beats/min. Her hair appears thinned. She has mild proximal muscle weakness.</p>
        <p>What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>

      <b>Option D (Hyperthyroidism) is Correct.</b>
      All the features fit with hyperthyroidism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A (Acromegaly) is Incorrect.</b>
      Acromegaly patients can have greasy oily skin. The other features are much more suggestive of hyperthyroidism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Conn's syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      Normally asymptomatic, but can present with polydipsia, polyuria, muscle weakness and hypertension. The triad of hypertension, hypokalaemia and alkalosis indicates Conn's syndrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Cushing's syndrome) is Incorrect.</b>
      This presents with proximal weakness, male pattern baldness, truncal obesity, moon face, but normal pulse. The patient can present with depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E (Phaeochromocytoma) is Incorrect.</b>
      Consists of hypertension, headache, heart failure and sweating. The hair pattern of an individual is not affected.
