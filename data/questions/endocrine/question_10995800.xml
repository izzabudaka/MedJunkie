      <b>Option C (Serum insulin growth factor-1) is Correct.</b>
      Acromegaly is usually due to a pituitary adenoma. Growth hormone excess will cause an increase in insulin growth factor-1. It is a stimulator of cell proliferation and growth. The figure shows that this patient has an enlarged mandible and nose, and  prominent supraorbital ridge.

      <b>Option A (24-hour urinary cortisol) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is used to detect excess cortisol in Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's can cause truncal obesity and, if due to a pituitary adenoma, could cause visual field changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Random urinary glucose) is Incorrect.</b>
      Glycosuria is present in diabetes mellitus. It causes an osmotic diuresis leading to polyuria and polydipsia, ultimately causing weight loss due to dehydration and a tissue catabolism (fat/muscle) due to insulin deficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D (Short synacthen test) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is used in Addison's disease. After administration it causes plasma cortisol levels to rise in a normal individual. It does not cause coarse facial features.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E (Thyroid function test) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is used to measure thyroid function. Tiredness would occur in hypothyroidism and sweating in hyperthyroidism. It does not cause coarse facial features.
