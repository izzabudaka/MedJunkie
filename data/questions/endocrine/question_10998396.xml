      <prompt>
        <p>You are asked to perform a clinical examination of a 49-year-old female who complains of tingling in her hands. On inspection she has ‘moist’ skin and her voice is ‘croaky’. There is a protruding brow and lingual hypertrophy. There is no hand tremor.</p>
        <p>What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>

    <p>
      <b>Option A (Acromegaly) is Correct.</b>
      Her presenting complaint could be carpal tunnel syndrome (seen in acromegaly or hypothyroidism) or hypoparathyroidism. The croaky voice occurs in acromegaly and hypothyroidism (the latter due to goitre compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve). However, only acromegaly has coarse facial features and tongue enlargement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Addison's disease) is Incorrect.</b>
      Indicated by postural hypotension, muscle weakness and fatigue, increased pigmentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Hypoparathyroidism) is Incorrect.</b>
      Indicated by muscle spasms and cramps, paraesthesia in hands, feet and peri-orally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D (Hyperthyroidism) is Incorrect.</b>
      Indicated by tremor, sweating, anxiety, heat intolerance, tachycardia, proximal myopathy and hyperreflexia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E (Hypothyroidism) is Incorrect.</b>
