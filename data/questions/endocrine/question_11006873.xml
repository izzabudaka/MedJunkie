        <p>A 55-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of difficulty getting up his stairs and generalized weakness. He has gained weight and denies dyspnoea but has a reduced exercise tolerance. His past medical history includes asthma and his medication includes salbutamol and long-term oral prednisolone. On examination there is reduced muscle power and bulk. His face seems puffy.</p>
        <p>What is the cause of his proximal myopathy?</p>

      <b>Option B (Cushing's syndrome) is Correct.</b>
      Iatrogenic use of steroid on a long-term basis causes Cushing's syndrome. Catabolism effects of the steroid cause reduction in muscle bulk.
