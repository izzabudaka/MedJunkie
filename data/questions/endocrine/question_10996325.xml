      <prompt>
        <p>You see a 35-year-old man in clinic who presents with new onset polydipsia and polyuria. He tells you he drinks at least 2 litres of water a day and feels irritable and thirsty if he does not. He is well, although you note he had meningitis last year and was involved in a car crash 3 months ago, sustaining a fractured skull. You note a recent sodium level of 150 mmol/l (normal range 135–145 mmol/l); potassium is normal at 3.8 mmol/l (normal range 3.3–4.7 mmol/l). You decide to perform a random urine and serum osmolality, as he tells you the colour of his urine is always very pale. The results obtained are:</p>
        <p>Serum osmolality: 305 mOsm/kg (normal range 280–296 mOsm/kg)</p>
        <p>Urine osmolality: 250 mOsm/kg (normal range 500–800 mOsm/kg</p>
        <p>What is the diagnosis?</p>

    <p>
      <b>Option D is Correct.</b>
      Causes of cranial diabetes insipidus include meningitis and head injury. Diabetes insipidus is due to impaired water resorption by the kidney because of reduced ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A is Incorrect.</b>
      This causes hyponatraemic hypovolaemia, with postural hypotension and pigmentation. In addition, potassium here is normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B is Incorrect.</b>
      Conn's Syndrome leads to primary hyperaldosteronism causing increased salt and water retention and decreased renin release. This would cause a low potassium level, and does not explain the polydipsia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C is Incorrect.</b>
      Cushing's syndrome leads to excessive mineralocorticoid release. However, this patient does not present with classic signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E is Incorrect.</b>
      This leads to increased ADH secretion from the pituitary gland, which leads to hyponatraemia and water retention.
