      <prompt>
        <p>A 78â€“year-old woman presents with a rapidly enlarging anterior neck swelling. On examination, she has enlarged cervical lymph nodes. A chest X-ray demonstrates a deviated trachea. You suspect thyroid cancer.</p>
        <p>What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>

    <p>
      <b>Option A (Anaplastic) is Correct.</b>
      This is an aggressive tumour that carries a very poor prognosis. It is most common in elderly women. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is rapidly growing and locally invasive, with early lymphatic metastases. Treatment is usually palliative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Follicular) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is indistinguishable from thyroid follicular adenoma. If follicular cells are isolated on cytology, a thyroidectomy is advised. It commonly presents in women in their late 40s and 50s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Medullary) is Incorrect.</b>
      Medullary cancer arises in parafollicular C cells of the thyroid. It is associated with phaeochromocytoma as part of the MEN2 syndrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D (Papillary) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is the most common form of thyroid cancer. It typically presents in young women and in patients with previous irradiation to the neck. Treatment is total or hemithyroidectomy. It has a good prognosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E (Thyroid lymphoma) is Incorrect.</b>
      This is a solid tumour of lymphatic cells found in the thyroid gland. There is an association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
