        <p>A 45-year-old woman complains of tingling in her hands. On inspection, she has ‘moist’ skin, loss of the outer third of her eyebrow hair and her voice is ‘croaky’. There is no hand tremor and her pulse is 55 beats/min. Tinel's test is positive.</p>
        <p>What is the most likely site of a lesion causing these features?</p>

    <p>
      <b>Option E (Thyroid gland) is Correct.</b>
      The patient's tingling is due to carpal tunnel syndrome which can occur with acromegaly or hypothyroidism. The croaky voice occurs in acromegaly and hypothyroidism (the latter due to a goitre compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve); however, bradycardia and eyebrow loss occur with hypothyroidism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A (Adrenal gland (cortex)) is Incorrect.</b>
      Cortisol excess results in truncal obesity, skin thinning and bruising. It would not cause bradycardia and paraesthesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B (Parathyroid gland) is Incorrect.</b>
      This would result in symptoms of hypercalcaemia (bones, groans, stones and psychic moans). Hypocalcaemia could cause paraesthesia in the hands and feet with perioral tingling; however, Tinel's test would be negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C (Pituitary corticotroph) is Incorrect.</b>
      This could result in visual changes (optic chiasma compression), skin pigmentation (due to melanocyte stimulating factor) as well as changes due to cortisol excess. It would not cause bradycardia and paraesthesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D (Pituitary somatotroph) is Incorrect.</b>
      This would result in acromegaly which would cause some of the features described. The discriminating features are the bradycardia and facial hair loss.
