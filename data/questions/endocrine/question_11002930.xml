      <prompt>
        <p>A 44-year-old type 1 diabetic is admitted for an elective right hemicolectomy for suspected cancer the evening before surgery. She normally takes Novorapid 10â€“12 U t.i.d. with glargine 18 U nocte and is on no other medication. She is otherwise well and first on the list for the morning so will be starved from 2 am.</p>
        <p>What is the most appropriate management of her diabetes peri-operatively while she is fasting?</p>
      </prompt>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_000">Allow to eat until goes to theatre</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_001">Give reduced dose of insulin in the morning</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_002">Give usual dose of insulin in the morning</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_003">Omit insulin until returns from theatre</simpleChoice>
      <simpleChoice identifier="CHOICE_004">Start sliding scale insulin from 2 am</simpleChoice>

      <b>Option E is Correct.</b>
      This is the most appropriate step. Careful peri-operative glycaemic control has been shown to improve outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A is Incorrect.</b>
      She should be starved for 6 hours preoperatively due to the risk of aspiration at induction of anaesthesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B is Incorrect.</b>
      Even with a reduced dose there is a significant risk of hypoglycaemia given the period of starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C is Incorrect.</b>
      Without a source of carbohydrate there is the significant risk of hypoglycaemia with this strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D is Incorrect.</b>
      There is a risk of ketoacidosis with this strategy. While omitting insulin and careful monitoring of blood sugars may be reasonable for more minor procedures this is not appropriate for major abdominal surgery.
