      <prompt>
        <p>A 70-year-old woman is admitted to the Orthopaedic ward for elective arthroplasty. Her blood results reveal a potassium level of 6.7 mmol/l (normal range 3.3â€“4.7 mmol/l). An ECG is performed by the doctor on call, which shows flattening of the P waves, tall tented T waves and wide QRS.</p>
        <p>What is the most appropriate immediate management while more senior help is awaited?</p>

    <p>
      <b>Option A is Correct.</b>
      As ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalaemia are present, calcium gluconate must be administered to stabilize the conductive membranes of the myocardium. This is the single life-saving treatment measure. Thereafter and under the supervision of a senior doctor, definitive treatment should be provided to lower the potassium level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B is Incorrect.</b>
      Calcium resonium is only used as maintenance therapy to keep potassium levels low after emergency treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C is Incorrect.</b>
      A valid emergency treatment to drive potassium into cells, dextrose and insulin should be administered only once cardioprotective calcium gluconate has been initiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D is Incorrect.</b>
      Dialysis is the definitive treatment for refractory hyperkalaemia. However, it takes time to set up emergency dialysis and initial cardioprotective measures are indicated immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option E is Incorrect.</b>
      A valid emergency treatment to drive potassium into cells, an inhaled beta
      <sub>2</sub>
      agonist should be administered only once cardioprotective calcium gluconate has been initiated.
