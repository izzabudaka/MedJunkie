      <b>Option E is Correct.</b>
      Fibroadenosis is a benign breast condition where one or more lumps are present with symptoms of pain and nodularity, which is characteristically associated with the patient's menstrual cycle. It presents in premenopausal women.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option A is Incorrect.</b>
      Breast abscess presents as a tender, swollen lump. It often has a significant amount of overlying skin erythema. There may be a fluctuant area, surrounded by induration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option B is Incorrect.</b>
      Breast cysts are discrete, fluid-filled swellings within the breast. They are smooth and mobile and can lead to localized tenderness. They are common in premenopausal women.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option C is Incorrect.</b>
      Fat necrosis occurs following trauma to the breast. It presents as a hard lump which is attached to the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Option D is Incorrect.</b>
      A fibroadenoma is a benign, solitary, solid, rubbery breast lesion, which is characteristically smooth, non-tender and freely mobile. It is common in young women.
