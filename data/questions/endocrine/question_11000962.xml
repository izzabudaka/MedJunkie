      <prompt>
        <p>A 47-year-old man presents with a history of feeling unwell and excessive sweating. He tells you he has recently increased in shoe size and his wedding ring no longer fits, although his weight has remained stable. He is being referred to the Orthopaedic team for carpal tunnel syndrome. On examination, you notice that he has a prominent lower jaw, with poor occlusion of the teeth. The hands are large and spade-shaped, with thickened skin. The patient is sweating at rest. Secondary sexual characteristics are normal.</p>
        <p>What is your diagnosis?</p>
