        <ce:para id="p0080">The psychiatric assessment is different from a medical or surgical assessment in that: (1)
            the history taking is often longer and is aimed at understanding psychological problems that develop in
            patients, each with a unique background and social environment; (2) a mental state examination is performed;
            and (3) the assessment can in itself be therapeutic.

                <ce:italic>Closed questions</ce:italic>
                limit the scope of the response to one or two word answers. They are used to gain specific information,
                and can be used to control the length of the interview when patients are being over-inclusive. For
                example:
                <ce:list id="l0055">
                    <ce:list-item id="u0085">

                </ce:list>
                Note that closed questions can be used at the very beginning of the interview as they are easier to
                answer and help to put patients at ease, e.g. ‘Do you live locally?’; ‘Are you married?’ (see
                ‘identifying information’ below).

                encourage the patient to answer freely with a wide range of responses and should be used to elicit the

                <ce:para id="p0530">The premorbid personality is an indication of the patient's personality and
                    character before the onset of mental illness. It can be difficult to ascertain retrospectively.
                    Indirect evidence of it can be provided from the personal history (e.g. have they ever been able to
                    hold down a job or been in a long-term relationship? Have their interests changed?). Patients may be
                    asked directly about their personality before they became ill, or it may be useful to ask a close
                    family member or friend about a patient's premorbid personality.

            <ce:para id="p0550">The mental state examination (MSE) describes an interviewer's objective impression of
                many aspects of a patient's mental functioning at a certain period of time. Whereas the psychiatric
                history remains relatively constant, the MSE may fluctuate from day to day or hour to hour. It is useful
                to try and gather as much evidence as possible about the MSE while doing the psychiatric history,
                instead of viewing this as a separate section. In fact, the MSE begins the moment you meet the patient.
                In addition to noting their appearance, you should observe how patients first behave on meeting you.
                This includes their body language and the way that they respond to your attempts to establish rapport.

                on the neurological and endocrine system. Always remember to look for signs relevant to the psychiatric
                history, e.g. signs of liver disease in patients who abuse alcohol, opthalmoplegia or ataxia in someone
                withdrawing from alcohol (indicating Wernicke's encephalopathy), signs of self-harm in patients with a
                personality disorder, signs of intravenous drug use (track marks) in patients who use drugs. Also,
                examine for side-effects of psychiatric medication (e.g. parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, dystonia and
                hypotension). In an exam situation it may not be possible to complete an examination, but you should
                always mention that you would do so. Always make a point of mentioning your positive physical findings
                when summarizing the case.

                                            who recently agreed to voluntary hospital admission. He presented with a
                                            6-month history of hearing voices and bizarre beliefs that he was being
                                            subjected to government experiments. During this time his college attendance
                                            had been uncharacteristically poor, he had terminated his part-time work,
                                            and he had become increasingly socially withdrawn. He has no history of past
                                            psychiatric illness and denies the use of alcohol or illicit substances;
                                            however he did mention that his maternal uncle suffers from schizophrenia.
                                            On mental state examination he appeared unkempt and behaved suspiciously. He
                                            had delusions of persecution, reference and thought control as well as
                                            delusional perception. He also described second person command
                                            hallucinations and third person, running commentary hallucinations. He
                                            appeared to have no insight into his mental illness as he refused to
                                            consider that he might be unwell. There were no abnormalities on physical
                                            examination.
